This project applies Data Mining techniques to analyze two key datasets:

### Soil Quality Data – to uncover insights relevant to agriculture.
### COVID-19 Impact Data – to identify trends in public health.

The project integrates a complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline, including:

-  Data Exploration & Preprocessing – Cleaning, handling missing values, and normalization.
-  Visualization & Trend Analysis – Identifying patterns in the datasets.
-  Association Rule Mining – Using the Apriori algorithm to extract meaningful relationships from agricultural data.
-  Machine Learning Models : Classification (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest ) And Clustering (K-Means, DBScan )
-  Evaluation & Comparison – Assessing model performance using standard metrics.
-  Recommender System – Implementing a recommendation engine based on frequent itemsets.
